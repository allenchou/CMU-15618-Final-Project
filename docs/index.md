## Goals and Deliverables

### Plan to achieve

- Implement two sequential algorithms, Kruskal's algorithm and Borůvka's algorithms, as the baseline of our performance benchmark.
- Parallelize these two sequential algorithms in shared-memory model using OpenMP:
	- Krushal's algorithm with parallel sorting,
	- focus on different parallel sorting algorithms: enumeration sort, quick sort, sample sort
	- ~~Borůvka's algorithm with edge contraction.~~
- Benchmark the speedup performance of our parallel implementations under different types and sizes of input graphs. We plan to consider two kinds of graphs: dense graphs and sparse graphs.
- Explore the speedup performance on input graphs with power-law distribution.
- Implement a correctness checker using Boost

### Hope to achieve

- ~~Explore the speedup performance on input graphs with power-law distribution.~~
- Implement a faster shared-memory MST algorithm proposed by Bader _et al._.
- ~~Explore the possibility to implement parallel Krushal's and Borůvka's algorithms in message-passing model using MPI.~~
- Implement Krushal's algorithm using libstdc++ parallel mode.

## Progress

For the algorithm part, We have implemented most of Kruskal’s algorithm: including the sequential baseline, Kruskal with parallel sorting and sequential Filter-Kruskal.  For sequential baseline, we use C++ STL sorting algorithm, while in our parallel sorting,  we implement a recursive quicksort and use OpenMP task to parallelize it.  Although our qicksort implementation is slower than C++ STL sorting, the parallel version is faster than C++ STL sorting.

The parallel version of Filter-Kurskal is still under exploration.  The basic idea of Filter-Kruskal is to construct minimal spanning forest for small edges first, and then filter out large edges whose endpoints within the same tree and then run Filter-Kruskal on the remaining large edges.  It is a recursive algorithm and there is a strong dependency between each recursive layer.  We try to use OpenMP task dependency to generate tasks but the dependency makes the running time worse.  Instead of parallelizing the recursive tasks, we decided to focus on the tasks within each recursive layer: namely the partition and filter.  After the checkpoint, we are going to implement our partition and filter via prefix-sum.  So far, we just use C++ STL, which is a single thread algorithm.

For the graph generator, we implement a random graph generator:  For each pair of vertices $u$ and $v$, there is $p$ probability such that $e= (u, v)\in G$.  Once $e\in G$, the weight of $e$ is uniformly distributed on a given range.  Because the probability is a fixed value, our graph generator outputs a dense graph.  During our initial benchmark, we notice that Kruskal's algorithm spends most of its running time on sorting, therefore it is expected to get good speedup once we parallelize the sorting.  However, when we run the same data on sequential Filter-Kruskal, we get better running time, even better than Kruskal with parallel sorting. This inspires us to explore the performance of our implementation on different graph type. To accelerate the saving and loading data, we use binary file to store thedata.

## Poster deliverables

We will deliver the speedup graphs of our parallel implementations under different numbers of processors and different types and sizes of input graphs. We will also deliver speedup graphs, or tables, of different parallel components. We think a reasonable speedup with respect to the number of processors will demonstrate that demonstrate we did a good job. If we cannot get a good speedup, we will try to profile our implementations to show that the parallel overhead is inevitable under our testing platform and provide potential specs of the testing platform to improve the speedup of our implementations.

## Preliminary results

We conduct an initial benchmark with graph of node size 5000, 10000 and 20000 and edge probability 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2. We use *random-N-p* to represent the case of a random graph of node size $N$ and edge probability $p$. We use STL sorting implementation of sequential Kruskal's algorithm as our baseline. The running platform is on my personal MacBook Pro with 2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7 CPU. The result is shown as follows, in which the sequential sort represents our OpenMP implementation without OpenMP **#pragma**.

This result is only used to show that our OpenMP indeed has some speedup. Meanwhile, it reflects some potential issues in our implementation: we expect the speedup can be about $\times$6 because we have 6 cores in our CPU. However the result shows that it is about $\times$1.5 speedup. Even if we consider the speedup with respect to sequential sort, the speedup is still only about $\times$3. Therefore, further analysis and optimization is required to get better performance.

We breakdown the running time of baseline and sequential sort: Sorting takes about 84% running time in baseline and 91% running time in our sequential sort.

One interesting observation is that sequential filter is quite efficient, which indicates that there is a lot of useless sorting work in original Kruskal's algorithm.

## Issues
Issues that concern us the most have been discussed in previous sections. Here we summarize them into a list:

- How to optimize the parallel performance to fully utilize the CPU parallel resource. So far, our initial implementation can only achieve about $\times$3 w.r.t. our sequential sort implementation. Further optimization is required after we finished basic requirement.
- Parallel partition: it is not trivial to parallelize partition algorithm. The main reason is that the position of the element is not independent with others. One possible way is to use prefix-sum. It is natural to implement prefix-sum using SIMD model, such as CUDA or SSE CPU instruction. The performance of OpenMP implementation is unknown to us, so we need to spend some time to explore it.
- Different algorithms have different performance on different graph type. It is not enough to only consider random graph with uniform distribution. How to design the benchmark is also a potential issue in our project deliverables. So far, we consider to add sparse graph (constant vertex degree upper bound) and random graph with power-law distribution.
- There is no correctness checker in our current implementation. There is a MST implementation in Boost, which can be used as checker in our project. However, we are not sure whether it is easy for us to use it.
- We have noticed that C++ STL algorithm library is quite efficient in a single thread. We are worried about that the bad speedup performance is due to some unknown optimization in STL. One possible solution is to compute the speedup without STL. Another way is to take advantage of libstdc++ parallel mode. We have no experience using the later one so we put it in our extra goals.

# Proposal

[PDF](./proposal.pdf)

## Summary

We will parallelize sequential algorithms for minimum spanning tree, including Kruskal’s algorithm and Borůvka’s algorithm, evaluate the speedup performance, and profile our implementations.

## Background

In a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph, a _minimum spanning tree_ (MST) is a subset of edges that connectsall nodes together with the smallest total weights. It has been well-studied for nearly a century and can be solved in polynomial time with different greedy algorithms. For example, [Prim’s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm) uses the _cut-property_ of MST, and constructs the MST by adding the smallest edge that connects the current nodes set and the remaining nodes set. However, Prim’s algorithm is hard to parallelize in nature because each step depends on the current sub-graph built on previous steps.

In this project, we are going to focus on [Kruskal’s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm) and [Borůvka’s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm). Kruskal’s algorithm utilizes the _cycles-property_ and build the MST by adding the smallest edge that does not create a cycle. The edge sorting takes $O(\mid E\mid\log\mid E\mid)$ operations and building the MST takes $O(\mid E\mid\alpha(\mid V\mid))$ operations, where $\alpha$ is the inverse [Ackermann function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function). In practice, $\alpha(\mid V\mid)$ grows extremely slow and hence the overall complexity is $O(\mid E\mid\log\mid E\mid)$. Borůvka’s algorithm starts from making each node as an individual component, and then keeps finding and contracting the smallest edge for each component that connects to any other component. The overall complexity for Borůvka’s algorithm is $O(\mid E\mid\log\mid V\mid)$. In this project, we will focus on these two algorithms. We will implement theserial algorithms first, and then parallelize it in shared memory space.

## Challenges

Kruskal's algorithm involves two steps: firstly, sort all edges by its weights, and then keep adding edges if no cycle is produced. Although there is a parallel sorting algorithm for the first part, the second part is inherently sequential and can not be properly parallelized. This is because whether the new edge produce cycle depends on all previous added edges.

Borůvka's algorithm has two main steps. The first is to find the adjacent edge with the smallest weight for each connected component, and the second is to contract the selected edges. The first part can be parallelized by components (vertices). However, race condition happens when edge contraction happens on the same vertex. How to improve efficiency while keeping the correctness is a challenging problem. 

## Resources

We will implement all algorithms from scratch. There are several research papers about parallel MST (in References section). There is also a good summary in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_algorithms_for_minimum_spanning_trees). As far as we know, there is no code available online. We are going to run our initial experiment on GHC machines and [CloudLab](https://www.cloudlab.us/) if available.

## Platform Choice

We plan to use OpenMP as our parallel framework and choose GHC machines to test our implementation. After well-tested on GHC machines, we will try to run our benchmark experiments on CloudLab if available. We use the shared-memory model so we can not take advantage of the distributed cluster, but there are more powerful machines on CloudLab so it is still a good platform for us to do tests.
